# Python Flask Restful API Boilerplate with Database Integration

This boilerplate is a simple framework created to cut down the time when developing an API for python. 
It uses Flask for web routing and Pyrebase to interact with Google's mobile and web application tool Firebase.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you will need two frameworks: Flask and Pyrebase.

```
pip install flask
pip install pyrebase
```

### Installing

Download and move the files to the location of your choosing (maintaining the file structure). Having previously installed all the prerequisites, the application should be able to work right out of the box. If errors occur, please check you're using python 3.6 and all modules are up to date.
